All eight isomers of amyl alcohol are known. The most important is isobutyl carbinol, this being the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol, and consequently a constituent of fusel oil. It can be separated from fusel oil by shaking with strong brine , separating the oily layer from the brine layer and it, the portion boiling between 125 and 140 \u00b0C. being collected. For further purification it may be shaken with hot lime water, the oily layer separated, dried with calcium chloride and fractionated, the fraction boiling between 128 and 132 \u00b0C only being collected.\nThe 1730 definition of the word \"chemistry\", as used by Georg Ernst Stahl, meant the art of resolving mixed, compound, or aggregate bodies into their principles; and of composing such bodies from those principles.[15] In 1837, Jean-Baptiste Dumas considered the word \"chemistry\" to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces.[16] This definition further evolved until, in 1947, it came to mean the science of substances: their structure, their properties, and the reactions that change them into other substances - a characterization accepted by Linus Pauling.[17] More recently, in 1998, the definition of \"chemistry\" was broadened to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes, as phrased by Professor Raymond Chang.\nThe current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model.[36] Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules,[37] substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. This matter can be studied in solid, liquid, or gas states, in isolation or in combination. The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.\n\nThe chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.\nThe transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c917fbb5-bf89-41ed-955f-747b21d03fb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c917fbb5-bf89-41ed-955f-747b21d03fb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/economics.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-05", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-05", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9cc15d65-56ca-4d40-89d1-d5d648b32c2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/economics.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-05", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-05", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-05"}, "hash": "1bbbbb8246c2723a0a820d24a108245a604c346564a7cb5ad81d19464d23e037"}}, "hash": "5bbe2079cc56a7bd24961e78d6383948ba951760ba2d0e214c1803e05a2778f8", "text": "The Austrian School (also known as the Vienna School or the Psychological School ) is a Schools of economic thought|school of economic thought that emphasizes the spontaneous organizing power of the price mechanism. Austrians hold that the complexity of subjective human choices makes mathematical modelling of the evolving market extremely difficult (or Undecidable and advocate a \"laissez faire\" approach to the economy. Austrian School economists advocate the strict enforcement of voluntary contractual agreements between economic agents, and hold that commercial transactions should be subject to the smallest possible imposition of forces they consider to be (in particular the smallest possible amount of government intervention). The Austrian School derives its name from its predominantly Austrian founders and early supporters, including Carl Menger, Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk and Ludwig von Mises.\n\nEconomics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.  Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \"economics\" as a shorter term for \"economic science\" that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to \"mathematics\", \"ethics\", and so forth.[2]\n\nA focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work. Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents (such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers) and markets, and their interactions. Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.\n\n\t\tThe professionalization of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programs on the subject, has been described as \"the main change in economics since around 1900\".[93] Most major universities and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject, whether in the liberal arts, business, or for professional study; see Master of Economics.\n\n\t\t\n\t\tEconomics is the social science that studies the behavior of individuals, households, and organizations (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a decision (choice) is made by one or more resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. Economic science centers on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society.[1] They are the focus of economic analysis.[2]\n\n\t\tThe traditional concern of economic analysis is to gain an understanding of the processes that govern the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in an exchange economy.[3] An approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behavior under scarcity, may go as   s:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7977c180-e96a-4a85-9de4-45b668937db0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7977c180-e96a-4a85-9de4-45b668937db0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/health.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-05", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-05", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80e6edd5-7b23-4795-86b5-854bdca2d14b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/health.txt", "creation_date": "2023-11-05", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-05", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-05"}, "hash": "341809483c99c19bfc5aa3ab13d890cba1414ed5b6c446b60a0d7c031741abc6"}}, "hash": "c73fdb9379fb4facbc7d154668eec2194f7d28a2d618d9b6e45cf1c2be5f8fc2", "text": "which requires that you sit at a desk all day.  ; If you hate to talk\n     politics, don't associate with people who love to talk politics, etc.   Learn to live one day at a time.

So why was I sidelined with a heel injury for over two   s?  I listened to the manufacturer and changed my runners every 400 miles.  Come to think of it, why do I see so many runners with lower extremity injuries in my office?  The traditional answer to these questions has always been overuse often compounded by an underlying mechanical abnormality such as over-pronation or flat-feet.  The treatment, along with modification of training, physiotherapy, stretching etc. has always included a close look at the runner's footwear, often with recommendations about motion control, stability, cushioning, orthotics or custom molded insoles.\n I do not recommend that you run your next half-marathon barefoot.  But certainly, I predict that sooner or later, changes will come about in both shoe design and training.  From the medical establishment's point of view, the prevention and treatment of running injuries must change to incorporate the concepts outlined above.  In fact I view the ideas I've presented here as a major paradigm shift in sports medicine, the likes of which I have not seen in the last fifteen years.
